                  In our entire solar system, the only object that shines with its own light is the
                  Sun. That light always beams onto Earth and Moon from the direction of the Sun,
                  illuminating half of our planet in its orbit and reflecting off the surface of the
                  Moon to create moonlight. Like Earth, the Moon has a day side and a night side,
                  which change as the Moon rotates. The Sun always illuminates half of the Moon
                  while the other half remains dark, but how much we are able to see of that
                  illuminated half changes as the Moon travels through its orbit. The Moon changes
                  its apparent shape with four distinct phases depending on the Moon's position as
                  it orbits around the Earth, and the Earth's position as it orbits around the Sun.
